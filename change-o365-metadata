# The UPN of an object in Azure AD will not synchronize with an On-Premise AD, despite all other aspects of the object changing simply. This results in users being unable to
# sign into the account they had their UPN changed for, particularly if the UPN is an email address. This UPN can only be changed through PowerShell. Use the commands below
# to do that.

# Imports the Microsoft Online Service.
Import-MsolService

# Connects to the Microsoft Online Service. If you're using this command on a new computer, you'll want to Import-MsolService first.
Connect-MsolService

# Check on the status of the account in question. The UPN is either the username or a full email address, depending on the environment.
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName [String]

# After validating the account information, prepare to change the UPN with the following.
Set-MsolUserPrincipalName -UserPrincipalName [String] -NewUserPrincipalName [String]

# For good measure, repeat this command to check if it worked. 
Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName [String]
